There are many guidelines... but we focus on Ben Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules.

### 8 Golden Rules

One of the strengths of these guidelines is that they are generic enough such that they have lasted 30 years even whilst technology has advanced to the point that was not foreseeable - like Apps on Apple Watch.

>[!note] I have added the examinable reading for the golden rules in the notes below!

1. Strive for Consistency
2. Seek universal usability
3. Offer informative feedback
4. Design dialogs to yield closure
5. Prevent Errors
6. Permit easy reversal of actions
7. Keep users in control
8. Reduce Short-term memory load.

##### Strive for Consistency:
In terms of menus, layout, fonts, colours. The only time we break this rule is when we want to show significance, such as a `Delete` command. With consistency (making user interface consistent, like using the same fonts, colours, e.t.c.) we can keep the user on auto-pilot as everything is familiar enough to the point where we can influence them with [[compYear2/swe2/UI - Dark Patterns|Dark Patterns]] - as they will likely not read all the content on the screen. 


##### Seek Universal Usability
Think of the end-users, at all ends from the novice to the expert and adding features for each. We have to think of age ranges, disabilities, devices and even Situations - like being on the move or weather...
Add features for novices, and features for experts.


##### Offer Informative Feedback
==Error feedback==
Always offer some form of feedback with level of response normal equating to how frequent and severe the action was.

- Say what happened and why?
- Suggest what to do next!
- Don't use Developer Jargon... (so do not use specialised developer language, but simplistic or accessible language)


##### Design Dialogs to Yield Closure
After a series of actions, if a task is accomplished - tell the user! The user should not be questioning if the action they performed was actually done.
(If a task is finished or the workflow is done, say it or give a notification)


##### Prevent Errors
(Data checks and validation)
Design the UI such that the user cannot make serious errors.. and should errors be made, simple and constructive instructions are provided for recovery.


##### Permit Easy Reversal of Actions
(Universal)
As much as possible actions should be reversible such that users are not scared to explore.


##### Keep Users in Control
This more so frustrates experienced users when they struggle to get the desired output, or have to tediously enter data..


##### Reduce Short-term Memory Load
A rule of thumb is that a user can remember 7Â±2 chunks of information, whether this applies to when inputting information and outputting information - you generally have to take into account the device that the user is using whilst this exchange happens.

##### Information Overload

Overcrowding of icons and data, so many excessive icons etc
To fix this, we can group similar functionalities so content is disclosed on demand
