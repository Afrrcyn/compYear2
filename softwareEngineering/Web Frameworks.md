# Introduction to MVC

MVC (Model - View - Controller) is primarily used to implement user interfaces. Developed for desktop applications but is now commonly used for web applications as well.

MVC provides a complete framework within which to build our software

## MVC Components

1. **Model**: Central component of the pattern. This is the applicationâ€™s data structure completely independent of the user interface. It contains and manages the data, logic and rules of the application. The model is often implemented as a database with various application specific transformations alongside it.
2. **View**: Represents the data, or a subset of the data, in the model to the user. A view of the data or a view into the data. Often desirable to have multiple representations or views of data
3. **Controller**: Controller accepts input and passes it on as commands to the view or model. Machinery behind the user interface or view, while being independent of them.

## Putting MVC into Practice

Responses and feedback are fed back to the controller, however this is fine as the MVC is flexible. A good reason to use the controller in this way, in a web implementation of the MVC pattern, is that when the user makes a request they will - either implicitly or explicitly request the response to be in a particular format. For example, some clients can ask for html or XML formats.

The controller, as the interpreter of user actions, has that information so is in, so has a good position to apply a particular view to a response.

So when mapping MVC into the real world, it is worth noting that: 

1. It can be messy
2. Might require some trade-offs
3. More than one way to do it
