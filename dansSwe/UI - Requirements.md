How do we go from Requirements to Design? Well there are two types of requirements.

Functional - Describe what the website should do!
Non-Functional - Describe how the functional requirements should be met.

So how can we go from requirements to design? Well there are different things we can do:

- Simple paper sketch
- Wireframe - more elaborate designs - focusing on layout - single page
- Mockups - all characteristics of wireframe - add UI controls - multi-page with links
- Prototypes - hard-coded solutions but almost exactly the final product.

But the higher you go up this list, the more time it takes.. for instance a prototype can take almost as much time as it takes to build the real thing...

Why do we want these things?
- Confirm we are completing the requirements
- Shows the range of choices as we can exchange ideas
- Prevents misunderstandings
- helps us to follow a top-bottom approach (breaking it down into more smaller and tangible tasks)
