Dark Patterns are user interfaces that benefit online services by leading and manipulating users into making decisions they otherwise would not have made.

Over the past 3 decades Dark Patterns have emerged from 3 previous trends; Deceptive Practices, Nudging and Growth Hacking.

One common deceptive practise that retail has been doing for decades is making the price of something slightly less than a whole number: £399, £3.99, it allows you to underestimate how much money you have spent whilst shopping.

What do Dark Patterns even want??
- Your Money
- Your Data (can sell)
- Your Attention (ads and your attention is not on a competitor)

##### Nudging
This is the act of businesses slightly nudging us based on internal cognitive biases and a lack of knowledge on certain areas.

For example, most people tend not to change the default option, so if you want users to make a certain choice, make it their default option, as sticking with the default option requires less effort or decision-making.

##### Growth Hacking
Focusing on growth before revenue, where this becomes a problem is where markets become saturated and so they have to adapt to more manipulative methods to grow.

Two methods growth hackers love to use are:
- Nudging
- A/B testing

>[!note] A/B testing?
>Serving variants of web pages to subsets of random users and it allows you to discover how seemingly trivial changes may impact the behaviour of your end user. 


### Numbers
Any stat I find is put here..

- After justFab found out false countdown timers work, over 140 shopping websites added similar timers.
- Over 1200 Shopping Websites and over 95% of (popular) Android Apps have Dark Patterns
- Nudging started to become a thing in the 1970s with researchers asking about the price of a bottle of wine.
- Earliest form of growth hacking was Hotmail in 1996 whereby they automatically made the signature of all emails 'Get your free email with Hotmail'
- Google was fined 50 million by the EU for hiding certain settings behind 5 or 6 screens.
